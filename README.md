### 1. Philosophy and Strategy Foundations
**Market Hypothesis**: Capitalizes on the statistical tendency of assets to mean-revert within defined volatility corridors. Based on:
- **Volatility Regime Analysis**: Differentiates between contraction/expansion phases
- **Theta Decay Acceleration**: Non-linear time decay (∂²Θ/∂t²) peak at 30-45 DTE
- **Extreme Event Pricing**: Overpricing of tail risks in options markets

**Key Innovations**:
- Volatility-normalized strike selection
- Dynamic wing sizing based on VIX term structure
- Adaptive position sizing using Kelly Criterion variants
- Machine learning-based earnings risk filter

---

### 2. Quantitative Framework and Mathematical Model

#### A. Volatility Assessment
```python
# IV Rank Calculation
def iv_rank(current_iv, historical_ivs):
    iv_min = np.percentile(historical_ivs, 20)
    iv_max = np.percentile(historical_ivs, 80)
    return (current_iv - iv_min) / (iv_max - iv_min) * 100

# Term Structure Adjustment
vix_contango = (VIX_3m - VIX_1m) / VIX_1m
wing_adjustment = 1 + (0.5 * vix_contango)  # Expands wings in contango
```

#### B. Probability Model
Uses modified Black-Scholes with fat-tail adjustment:
```
P(OTM) = N(d₂) + κ * [∂³C/∂K³]  # Where κ = excess kurtosis factor
```

#### C. Greeks Management Targets
| Greek  | Target Range | Monitoring Frequency |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Theta  | > 0.3% of capital/day | Intraday |
| Delta  | ±0.05 per $1k capital | 15-min |
| Gamma  | < 0.0005 per $1k capital | Hourly |
| Vega   | < 0.08 per 1% IV change | Daily |

    A --> C[Price Action Monitor]
    B --> D[Strike Selection Engine]
    C --> D

### 4. Pre-Trade Analysis Engine

#### A. Underlying Selection Criteria
| Parameter | Requirement | Validation Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Price | $50-$500 | 20-day median |
| Daily Volume | > 1M shares | 3-month average |
| Options Liquidity | Bid-Ask ≤ 0.3% | Time-weighted spread |
| IV Rank | 30-70% | 2-year historical IV |

#### B. Market Regime Filters
```python
# Market Health Check
def market_approval():
    return (
        (vix < 25) and
        (put_call_ratio(10) < 1.2) and
        (skew_index(25d) > -10) and
        (advancers_ratio > 0.4)
    )
```

#### C. Earnings and Events Shield
```python
# Earnings Risk Model
earnings_risk = earnings_volatility_boost * analyst_dispersion
if earnings_risk > 2.5 or days_to_earnings < 7:
    reject_trade()
```

---

### 5. Trade Construction Methodology

#### A. Strike Selection Algorithm
```python
# Short Strike Calculation
def get_short_strike(probability=0.30, is_call=False):
    distribution = implied_risk_neutral_distribution()
    return distribution.quantile(1 - probability) if is_call else distribution.quantile(probability)

# Wing Width Calculation
def calculate_wing(underlying_price, iv_rank):
    base_width = 0.015 * underlying_price
    volatility_adjustment = 1 + (iv_rank - 50) * 0.005
    return round(base_width * volatility_adjustment / strike_increment) * strike_increment
```

#### B. Credit Quality Check
```
Minimum Credit = (Width of Wing * 0.33) - Commission
Commission Factor = $0.65 * 4 contracts
```

#### C. Order Placement Protocol
1. Limit order at mid-point ± 10% of theoretical edge
2. Time-weighted partial fills over 15 minutes
3. Cancel if not 90% filled within 30 minutes

---

### 6. Position Management Protocol

#### A. Profit-Taking Rules
| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 50% max profit reached | Close entire position |
| 14 DTE with 35% profit | Close tested side |
| Gamma risk > threshold | Early close at 40% profit |

#### B. Defense Mechanisms
```mermaid
graph LR
    Price_Test -->|Test short put| Roll_Down[Roll put spread down]
    Price_Test -->|Test short call| Roll_Up[Roll call spread up]
    IV_Spike -->|>25% increase| Hedge[Buy VIX calls]
    Time_Decay -->|<21 DTE| Roll_Out[Roll to next cycle]
```

#### C. Adjustment Matrix
| Parameter | Adjustment | Trigger Condition |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Delta | Roll untested side | Position delta > ±0.15 |
| Vega | Widen wings | IV spike > 30% |
| Theta | Roll to next month | 21 DTE remaining |
| Gamma | Reduce size | Gamma exposure > 0.5% NAV |

---

### 7. Risk Management Framework

#### A. Capital Allocation System
```
Position Size = (Account Risk * Trade Probability) / (Stop Distance * Volatility Factor)
Where:
- Account Risk = 1% of NAV
- Trade Probability = 68% (1σ)
- Stop Distance = 1.5x credit received
- Volatility Factor = 1 + (IV Rank/100)
```

#### B. Circuit Breakers
1. Daily loss > 2% NAV: Reduce size by 50%
2. Weekly loss > 5% NAV: Pause trading for 48h
3. Monthly loss > 8% NAV: Full strategy reset

#### C. Portfolio Constraints
- Max 5 concurrent positions
- Sector exposure < 15% NAV
- Correlation factor < 0.6 between positions
